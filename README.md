A robot that sorts all 3 kinds of bottles (plastic, glass, and can ), into the correct box (recognized by its color ).

to build this project I had to build 2 machine learning models, the purpose of the first one was to specify what is the type of each box in the frame,
and the purpose of the second one is to specify the type of bottles in the frame.

We had to build the robot, the parts used to build the robot are Raspberry Pi, a robotic arm, DC motors, servo motors .....

We installed the models we created on Raspberry and developed an algorithm that uses the detection results to decide the next move.
